   # Debug APK (for testing)
   eas build --platform android --profile apk-debug
   
   # Release APK (for distribution)
   eas build --platform android --profile apk-release
   ```

4. **Build iOS App**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile preview
   ```

### Local Build (Advanced)

For local Android builds, use the provided batch script:
```bash
# Windows
./build-android.bat

# Note: Local builds require Android Studio, JDK 17+, and proper environment setup
```

## Configuration

### AI Diagnostics Setup

1. Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Open the app and go to Settings
3. Enter your Gemini API key
4. Enable AI Mode toggle
5. AI analysis will now be available when viewing DTC codes
